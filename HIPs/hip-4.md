## Simple Summary
A user should be able to recieve Verifiable Credential after doing KYC on hypersign , and then he should be able to provide it as KYC proof for trading on DEx on ( AE, ETH, BSC, POLYGON ) 


## Abstract
Assuiming that DEX's are going to be regulated their will be demand for them to do KYC . But currently the KYC on smart contract is either not possible or is completely broken when it comes to UX. The reason beng no propoer standardisation of KYC process for smart contract, Some are doing Whitelisting but user has to go through whitelisting on each platform seperately.  

## Motivation
If you see the current user behaviour since the Dex's do not have KYC and more and more networks are building bridges . The users are easily able to move tokens for example from Ethereumm to Binance using the bridges and trade on Uniswap and Pancake swap both. But this is going to change soon as soon as goverment impose regulation.



## Implementation idea
Need more research in this perhaps @vishwas1 can try
