## Simple Summary
A proposal for deterministic generation of DIDs and DID Documents using wallets (Metamask, keplr, etc) and a standard for verification of DIDs and DID Documents.

## Abstract
This proposal is for the deterministic generation of DIDs and DID Documents using wallets (Metamask, keplr, etc) and a standard for verification of DIDs and DID Documents. 
A user should be able to generate and verify a DID and DID Document using a wallet. The verification method attached to the DID Document should be able to verify the DID and DID Document by any other system that supports the verification method. Example- HID-Network (currently supports `Ed25519VerificationKey2020`).  

## Motivation
The motivation behind this proposal is to make the DID and DID Document generation and verification process more user-friendly. Right now Hypersign-Identity-Network only supports `Ed25519VerificationKey2020` verification method but web3 wallets such as keplr uses `secp256k1` algorithm for signing and verification. So its not possible to use the same wallet for DID-related signing/verification and for the blockchain of transactions. So right now our users have to use two different wallets ([HD-Ed25519](https://github.com/hypersign-protocol/hid-ssi-js-sdk/blob/ed25519-hd-poc/test/ssi/ed25519_hd_poc.js) for Identity Wallet, secp256k1 for blockchain) for signing/verifying DIDs and for signing/verifying blockchain transactions. This proposal will make it possible to use the same wallet for both DID and blockchain transactions. The main outcome of this proposal is a smooth user onboarding experience.

## Specification

#### Currently Supporting Specification:
- `Ed25519VerificationKey2020` for verification: [Link](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/ed25519-verification-key-2020)
- `Ed25519Signature2020` for signature: [Link](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/ed25519-signature-2020)
#### After this proposal is implemented we will be supporting the following specifications:
- `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019` for verification: [Link](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#ecdsasecp256k1verificationkey2019) 
- `EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019` for signature: [Link1](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ecdsa-secp256k1-2019/) [Link2](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/lds-ecdsa-secp256k1-2019)

- ecdsa256k1 Packge [Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bloomprotocol/ecdsa-secp256k1-verification-key-2019)

This is still in draft stage. I will update this section once the proposal is finalized.


## Rationale
The rationale behind this proposal.
- As our Hypersign-Identity-Network only supports the `Ed25519VerificationKey2020` verification method, we had to come up with a way to generate DID and DID Document using `Ed25519` Deterministically. So if a user remembers the seed phrase, he/she can re-generate the same DIDs and DID Documents.So there is no need to store the DID docs on the blockchain. It will work as private DID. [POC](https://github.com/hypersign-protocol/hypersign-knowledge-hub/tree/poc-HD-did/kepler-hs-ssi-sdk) 
- Right now our SDK can only be used by the wallet providers (if Kepler/other-wallet uses hid-ssi-sdk, they can provide Identity features to their users). Now our SDK has the potential to be used by the cosmos chain wallets. So the cosmos-enabled wallets can provide Identity features to the cosmos chain users. If wandering how? our SDK will be able to use the same mnemonic of the wallet(using hid-ssi-sdk) to generate DID and DIDDocument deterministically (`HD-Ed25519`).
- After achieving the above step, Now we propose an approach to generate DIDs and DID Documents using the public key of `secp256k1` wallets (Kepler, Metamask). This will make it possible to use the same wallet for both DID and blockchain transactions. The user doesn't have to provide a seed phrase/mnemonic to generate DIDs and DID Documents. The user can use the existing web3 wallet so the DID related task and the blockchain-related task can be done using the same wallet (Web3-Wallet/keplr). By attaching the `EdcsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019` verification method to the DID Document this scenario can be possible. (For that Hypersign-Identity-Network has to support the `EdcsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019` verification method). 


## Privacy Concerns
- The user has to provide the seed phrase/mnemonic to generate DIDs and DID Documents. So the user has to trust the daap/provider with the seed phrase/mnemonic.
- If any wallet provider such as keplr/Metamask uses our SDK, the user already trusts them as a reliable wallet provider.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal is backward compatible. The current DID and DID Document generation and verification process will work even after the acceptance of this proposal.
